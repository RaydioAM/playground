# Flow Control

**Flow Control** - How a program decides which Python instructions to execute under which conditions.

## Boolean Values
**Boolean** - A data type with only two values: `True` or `False`.
- Booleans are not treated as strings.
- Must start with a capital `T` or `F`.

## Comparison Operators
**Comparison Operator** (also called Relational Operators) - Compares two values and evaluates down to a single Boolean value.

### Comparisons
| Operator | Meaning |
|---|---|
| == | Equal to |
| != | Not equal to |
| < | Less than |
| > | Greater than |
| <= | Less than or equal to |
| >= | Greater than or equal to|

_Note: an integer or floating-point value will always be unequal to a string value._

## Boolean Operators
Operators that are used to compare Boolean values:
- `And`
- `Or`
- `Not`

### Binary Boolean Operators
`And` and `Or` are _binary_ operators because they always take two Boolean values.
- `And` - evaluates to `True` if both Boolean values are `True`.
