# Chapter 1 - Python Basics

## Integer, Floating-point, and String Data Types
Data Type | Examples
---|---
Integers | -2, 0, 1, 5
Floating-point numbers | -1.25, 0.0, 1.2
Strings | 'a', 'abcde', 'Ray'

## Concatenation
For integers or floating-point numbers, '+' will perform addition. However, on strings, it will concatenate, or combine the strings.

Example | Output
--- | ---
'Ray' + 'Laura' | RayLaura

**Note:** This operator cannot combine strings and integers.

## Variables
A **variable** is a place in the computer's memory where you can store a single value that can be used later. An **assignment statement** is used to store a value to a variable.

> someVariable = 12

The equals sign in the assignment statement is called an **assignment operator**. The process of storing a value within a variable for the first time is called **initialization**. Variables can be overwritten with new values.

### Allowed Variable Names
- One word with no spaces
- Only contains letters, numbers, or underscore (_)
- It cannot begin with a number

**Note:** Variable names are *case-sensitive*! (it's Python convention to start variable names with a lowercase)
